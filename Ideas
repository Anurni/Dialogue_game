Game planning 22/2/2024

-Typhoon-style simple Trivia game. Multiuser. Multiple levels?
-Choose a category (geography, maths, sports, history). 
        -What is the most spoken language in the world?
        -How many continents are there?
        -What is the smallest country in the world?

-Three levels. 
-User can choose the category but it cannot be the same on all levels.
-Hints. The user gets less points if they use the hints.
-When you answer correctly, you pick a box/card with points or symbols. In these boxes/cards, one of them will be Typhoon (player loses all their points), 
one of them will be bonus, couple of them will be some basic points??
-The user will choose a box
-When User1 cannot answer the question, possibility for User2 to steals points? (let's check how to do this)
-maybe we could give possible answers to the questions and the players can ask to remove some answer?
